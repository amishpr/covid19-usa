# Required Files \nThis project requires `us-states.csv` and `us-counties.csv` from [nytimes/covid-19-data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data). \n \nIf you wish to run this locally, please download `us-states.csv` and `us-counties.csv`, then place them in this folder. \n \nThe Github Action is setup to do this automatically and generate the `timeseries.json` and `timeseries-counties.json` file.
